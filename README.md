Do a question a day with Lincoln this summer! 

Problem 1: Suppose you are given a book (List of Strings), get the top n occurring words from it.

Problem 2: 
Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the 
	image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees
	Can you do this in place?
