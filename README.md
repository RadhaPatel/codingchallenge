Do a question a day with Lincoln this summer! 

13/45

Problem 1: Suppose you are given a book (List of Strings), get the top n occurring words from it.

Problem 2: Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place? 

Problem 3: One Away: There are 3 types of edits that can be preformed on strings: insert, remove, and replace a char. Given 2 strings, write a function to check if they are one efir (or zero edits) away;

Problem 4: Compress: Given a string compess it: aaabbbccc -> a3b3c3

Problem 5: Zero Matrix: if an element in an MxN matrix is zero then the entire row and column is zero

Problem 6: Route Between Nodes: Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes.

Problem 7: Minimal Tree: given a sorted array with unique number - create a BST with minimal height

Problem 8: List of Depth: Given a BST create a linked list of all the nodes at each depth. If the tree has D levels - then there will be D linked lists

Problem 9: Check Balanced: Check if a BST is balanced (meaning that the height of the subtrees of any node never differ by more than one)

Problem 10: Valid BST: Implement a function to check if a BT is a BST

Problem 11: Sorted Merge: Given 2 sorted arrays - where A has enough room to hold B merge the 2 in sorted order.

Problem 12: Group Anagrams: Sort an array of strings so that all the anagrams are next to each other...

Problem 13: Successor: Write an algorithm to find the next node (inorder successor) of a given node in a BST. Each node has a link to its parent.
